Binary to Octal conversion in C++
Here, we will discuss binary to octal conversion in C++.There are two approaches of converting an octal number into a binary number like

grouping the binary number into pairs of three and converting into octal.
By converting the binary number into a decimal number first and then convert that decimal number into an octal number.
We are using second approach, this approach is long but it is very easy to implement and also the chances of error are also very minimum.

Binary to octal
Method 1:-
We will first convert the Binary number into Decimal and then convert the Decimal number into Octal

Make sure that you have gone through these approaches below â€“
