/*
Octal to Binary Conversion
There are 2 approaches of converting an octal number into a binary number like:

Write 3 digit binary number for all the digits of a number from left to right. 
first convert octal to decimal and then decimal to binary .
We are using the second approach, it is a long but very simple approach which can also be implemented easily with minimum chances of error.

Octal to binary conversion
While loop in C
Method 1:-
Accept octal number
Convert it into decimal Equivalent
Convert this decimal value into Binary
