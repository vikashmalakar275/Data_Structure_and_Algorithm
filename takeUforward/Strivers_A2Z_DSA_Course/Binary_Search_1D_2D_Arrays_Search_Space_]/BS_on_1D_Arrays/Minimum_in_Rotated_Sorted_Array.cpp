/*
Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Now the array is rotated between 1 to N times which is unknown. Find the minimum element in the array. 

Pre-requisites: Search in Rotated Sorted Array I,  Search in Rotated Sorted Array II & Binary Search algorithm

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3]
Result: 0
Explanation: Here, the element 0 is the minimum element in the array.

Example 2:
Input Format: arr = [3,4,5,1,2]
Result: 1
Explanation: Here, the element 1 is the minimum element in the array.
