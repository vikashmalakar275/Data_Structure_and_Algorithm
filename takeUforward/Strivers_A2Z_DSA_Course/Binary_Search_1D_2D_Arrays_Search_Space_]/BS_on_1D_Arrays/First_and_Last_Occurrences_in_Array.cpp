/*
Problem Statement: Given a sorted array arr of n integers and a target value k. Write a program to find the indices of the first and the last occurrences of the target value. If the target is not found then return -1 as indices.

Note: Consider 0-based indexing

Pre-requisites: Lower Bound,  Upper Bound, & Binary Search

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: n = 8, arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 11, 13}, k = 8
Result: 3 5
Explanation: The first occurrence of 8 is at index 3 and the last occurrence is at index 5.

Example 2:
Input Format: n = 8, arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 11, 13}, k = 10
Result: -1 -1
Explanation: The target value is not present in the array. So, we have returned -1 as the indices of the first and the last occurrence.
