/*
Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3], k = 0
Result: 4
Explanation: Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

Example 2:
Input Format: arr = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], k = 3
Result: -1
Explanation: Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as -1.
