Problem Statement: Given an array ‘arr of integer numbers, ‘ar[i]’ represents the number of pages in the ‘i-th’ book. There are a ‘m’ number of students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students.
Allocate books in such a way that:

Each student gets at least one book.
Each book should be allocated to only one student.
Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.
You have to allocate the book to ‘m’ students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimum. If the allocation of books is not possible. return -1

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: n = 4, m = 2, arr[] = {12, 34, 67, 90}
Result: 113
Explanation: The allocation of books will be 12, 34, 67 | 90. One student will get the first 3 books and the other will get the last one.

Example 2:
Input Format: n = 5, m = 4, arr[] = {25, 46, 28, 49, 24}
Result: 71
Explanation: The allocation of books will be 25, 46 | 28 | 49 | 24.

We can allocate books in several ways but it is clearly said in the question that we have to allocate the books in such a way that the maximum number of pages received by a student should be minimum.


Assume the given array is {25 46 28 49 24} and number of students, M = 4. Now, we can allocate these books in different ways. Some of them are the following:


25 | 46 | 28 | 49, 24  → Maximum no. of pages a student receive = 73
25 | 46 | 28, 49 | 24  → Maximum no. of pages a student receive = 77
25 | 46, 28 | 49 | 24  → Maximum no. of pages a student receive = 74
25, 46 | 28 | 49 | 24  → Maximum no. of pages a student receive = 71

From the above allocations, we can clearly observe that the minimum possible maximum number of pages is 71.


When it is impossible to allocate books:


When the number of books is lesser than the number of students, we cannot allocate books to all the students even if we give only a single book to each student. So, if m > n, we should return -1.


Observations:


Minimum possible answer: We will get the minimum answer when we give n books of the array to n students(i.e. Each student will receive 1 book). Now, in this case, the maximum number of pages will be the maximum element in the array. So, the minimum possible answer is max(arr[]).
Maximum possible answer: We will get the maximum answer when we give all n books to a single student. The maximum no. of pages he/she will receive is the summation of array elements i.e. sum(arr[]). So, the maximum possible answer is sum(arr[]).

From the observations, it is clear that our answer lies in the range [max(arr[]), sum(arr[])].


How to calculate the number of students to whom we can allocate the books if one can receive at most ‘pages’ number of pages:


In order to calculate the number of students we will write a function, countStudents(). This function will take the array and ‘pages’ as parameters and return the number of students to whom we can allocate the books.


countStudents(arr[], pages):


1. We will first declare two variables i.e. ‘students’(stores the no. of students), and pagesStudent(stores the number of pages of a student). As we are starting with the first student, ‘students’ should be initialized with 1.
2. We will start traversing the given array.
3. If pagesStudent + arr[i] <= pages: If upon adding the pages with the existing number of pages does not exceed the limit, we can allocate this i-th book to the current student.
4. Otherwise, we will move to the next student(i.e. students += 1 ) and allocate the book.

Finally, we will return the value of ‘students’.
