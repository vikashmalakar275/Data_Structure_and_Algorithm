/*
Problem Statement: Given two numbers N and M, find the Nth root of M. The nth root of a number M is defined as a number X when raised to the power N equals M. If the â€˜nth root is not an integer, return -1.

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: N = 3, M = 27
Result: 3
Explanation: The cube root of 27 is equal to 3.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 4, M = 69
Result: -1
Explanation: The 4th root of 69 does not exist. So, the answer is -1.

//Time Complexity: O(M), M = the given number.
//Reason: Since we are using linear search, we traverse the entire answer space.
//Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

//Time Complexity: O(logN), N = size of the given array.
//Reason: We are basically using binary search to find the minimum.
//Space Complexity: O(1)
//Reason: We have not used any extra data structures, this makes space complexity, even in the worst case as O(1).
